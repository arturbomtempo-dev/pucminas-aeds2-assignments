        PUC Minas - Data Structures and Algorithms II (DSA2) - Activities and Implementations
    </h1>
    <p align="center">
        This repository was developed with the aim of consolidating the concepts of Algorithms and Data Structures II (AEDS2) in a practical and applied way. It contains implementations of abstract data structures, sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and other essential topics from the course. Additionally, it includes the code for practical and theoretical activities, Beecrowd exercises for exam revision, and other materials to assist students' learning, offering practical examples that complement the theoretical content from the course at PUC Minas.

## üìÅ Setup and Run the Application

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before getting started, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

-   [Java](https://www.java.com/pt-BR/) and [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) to compile and run Java files.
-   [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) to compile and run C files.

It is also recommended to use a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### üöÄ How to Run the Application Locally

#### To run the Java application:

1. Open the folder where the `Main.java` file is located:

```bash
$ cd path/to/java/folder
```

2. Compile the Java code:

```bash
$ javac Main.java
```

3. Run the Java application:

```bash
$ java Main
```

#### To run the C application:

1. Open the folder where the `Main.c` file is located:

```bash
$ cd path/to/c/folder
```

2. Compile the C code:

```bash
$ gcc -o main Main.c
```

3. Run the C application:

```bash
$ ./main
```
